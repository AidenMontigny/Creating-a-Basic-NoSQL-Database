<h1> Creating a Basic NoSQL Database </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The NoSQL Database project demonstrates the creation and manipulation of a MongoDB database for managing hotel data. The project includes steps such as creating a new collection for storing hotel documents, adding details like hotel name, address, room rates, and room types. Additionally, the project showcases the process of updating hotel documents by including unique amenities for each hotel. It also covers the removal of specific data—specifically, the amenities for one hotel—highlighting the flexibility of NoSQL databases in managing dynamic data structures. This project emphasizes the practical use of MongoDB for handling non-relational data and performing CRUD operations efficiently.
